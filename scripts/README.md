## Parsing logs
`sycl_bench_parser.py`:
    - input: sycl_bench results file
    - output: csv file with the following header:
        kernel-name, core-freq, memory-freq, kernel-time [s], run-time [s], energy [J]
    - command line args:
        argv[1] -> path to sycl-bench results
        argv[2] -> path to output directory

## Compute energy metrics
`add_energy_metrics.py`:
    - input: csv file generated with sycl_bench_parser.py
